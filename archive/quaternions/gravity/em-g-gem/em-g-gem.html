<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Newton&#8217;s law of gravity remains the most useful description of gravity for rocket scientists unless
high precision measurements are made. Yet Newton&#8217;s scalar law is inconsistent with special
relativity so must be corrected. General relativity is the only way to fix this issue which is
consistent with all weak and strong tests of gravity to date.Will&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#XWill2006">19</a>] Yet no one has succeeded in
80 years to quantize this rank 2 field theory. Because the brightest minds on the planet
have not succeeded for such a long time, it may be reasonable to suppose that the
task cannot be done. If so, a starting point should be a field theory with infinite reach
that has been quantized: the rank 1 field theory for electromagnetism, the Maxwell
equations.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Classical electromagnetic theory has been remarkably robust to modern innovations. It was the
inspiration for special relativity and did not need alteration unlike Newtonian mechanics. As
quantum mechanics evolved, the Maxwell equations remained the same. Technical changes were
required, such as the potential became an operator, and a gauge had to be chosen to
determine the propagator. The advent of general relativity did not alter electromagnetism.
Instead, the solutions to the equations of general relativity provide a metric needed by
electromagnetism. The <span 
class="cmmi-12">U</span>(1) symmetry of electromagnetism served as the starting point for
the formation of the standard model, which unifies electromagnetism, the weak, and
the strong forces through the use of the gauge symmetries <span 
class="cmmi-12">U</span>(1), <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(2), and <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(3)
respectively.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   A rank 1 field theory for gravity is dismissed without proof in the literature.Gupta&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xgupta1957">7</a>],&#x00A0;Thirring&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xthirring1961">14</a>]
A current survey omits the formal possibility of a rank 1 field theory because no hypothesis
consistent with current tests has been made (C. Will, personal communication). Any proposal
modeled too closely on Maxwell would have like charges repel, a fatal starting point. Let us accept
the unspoken consensus: a rank 1 field theory for gravity cannot be formulated with the tools at
hand.
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   Steps forward in physics have often relied on math tools developed in the past that find new
applications. Tensors have proved to be among the most useful tools available to write equations.
Tensors can be added together, multiplied by a scalar, are true no matter what the choice of
coordinates, and work in an arbitrary number of dimensions. It is this last property whose utility
for more than 4 spacetime dimensions has yet to be confirmed by experiment. One could trade this

property for another that demonstrably had more utility. For this paper, I will only
use math tools that are defined in time and 3D space, for a total of four dimensions.
Quaternions have the first three properties cited for tensors, but are restricted to work in
four dimensions. For those who have not worked extensively with quaternions (and
hypercomplex numbers), please see the first appendix, &#8220;Mathematical fields, quaternions
and hypercomplex numbers&#8221;. Quaternions have the property not inherent in tensors of
multiplying or dividing one quaternion by another. Given the central importance of
multiplication in mathematics, this obvious choice to work on problems in spacetime hits
roadblocks when applied to physics, causing people to work instead with complex-valued
quaternions.<span 
class="cmbx-12">?</span> ] Only relatively recently has a way to represent the Lorentz group been found
using real-valued quaternion triple products, but those results has not garnered much
attention.De&#x00A0;Leo&#x00A0;[<a 
href="#Xdeleo1996">4</a>]
<!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   This paper is based on variations on the Maxwell action, our best field theory. The
scalar of the action is rewritten with quaternions. As with all rewrites, this produces no
new physics. It does provide a means to connect to the standard model because the
gauge symmetry <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(2) is also known as the unit quaternions. I show in the second
appendix, &#8220;Standard model groups, tensors and quaternions&#8221; that quaternions will
provide a means to switch between the three gauge symmetries found in the standard
model.
<!--l. 144--><p class="indent" >   Experiments tell us that the effects of gravity can be accurately described by a dynamic metric.
A metric is symmetric, so changes in a dynamic metric are also symmetric. Quaternions will not
suffice for the task due to the antisymmetric curl. The hypercomplex numbers on the other hand
have a symmetric curl, so may be able to represent changes in a dynamic metric. The
hypercomplex rules of multiplication are used to create a variation on the Maxwell action. The
resulting action has like charges attract as happens for gravity. A metric solution is found which is
consistent with weak field tests, yet different for higher order experimental tests. General relativity
may have a new competitor, a symmetric variation of electromagnetism via an obscure
algebra.

   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">II.   </span> <a 
 id="x1-2000II"></a>The Maxwell Action Using Quaternions</h3>

<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >The classical action for electromagnetism has a contraction of an irreducible antisymmetric field
strength tensor and a coupling of electric charge density with the 4-potential tensor. Tensors can
be added together or multiplied by a scalar. Tensors form a group under addition with zero
as the identity. Tensor expressions are valid no matter what the choice of coordinate
systems. Tensors can be of arbitrary dimensions, but for this problem are constrained to
four.
<!--l. 168--><p class="indent" >   In this paper, tensors are upgraded to have the power to be multiplied or divided. Such a goal is
constrained for finite algebras to 1, 2, or 4 dimensions over the real numbers. Quaternions are a
mathematical field, meaning they are a group under the addition operator, and modulo division by
zero, a group under multiplication. In four dimensions, quaternions behave like tensors in that
they can be added together, be multiplied by a scalar and be written in an arbitrary choice of
coordinate systems.
<!--l. 177--><p class="indent" >   The standard way to write the Maxwell action has two Lorentz invariants: a current coupling
term and the difference between the squares of the electric and magnetic fields:

The E and B fields will transform like parts of a second rank tensor since their definition is the

field can be flipped by reversing the order of the differential and the potential. The
product of the differential and the potential written in both orders will generate the
difference of two squares. Another riddle is how to ensure <span 
class="cmmi-12">U</span>(1) symmetry for the current
coupling term. As usually taught, <span 
class="cmmi-12">U</span>(1) symmetry is the unit circle in the complex plane.
Quaternions can be considered to be three complex numbers that share the same real
value. A normalized quaternion represents a unit circle in the complex plane at some
angle in space. Use these observations to construct the Maxwell action using real-valued
quaternions:

<!--l. 214--><p class="nopar" >
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >   The scalar that results from this quaternion product is identical to the one generated via
tensors, so the physics is identical. It is interesting that a quaternion product as complicated as
this one has a first term that is Lorentz invariant, but it must have the same properties as the
Maxwell action. The rest of the quaternion product is the Poynting vector which provides a
measure of the change in energy density in space caused by the electric and magnetic
fields.
<!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >   The gauge symmetry for the weak force is the non-Abelian group <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(2) also known as
the unit quaternions. One way to represent the group is with the exponential of the
3-vector of a quaternion. Consider the following transformation of the electromagnetic
action:

<!--l. 234--><p class="indent" >   Both the current coupling and field strength density terms are guaranteed to have <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(2)
symmetry. Where there is symmetry in the action, there are conserved currents. Since the Lie
algebra <span

<!--l. 240--><p class="indent" >   The electroweak force sounds like the product of the electromagnetic and weak symmetries. Yet
the first is an Abelian group while the second is not. Quaternions are generally non-Abelian. They
are Abelian if two quaternions happen to point in the same direction, which always
happens when there is only one quaternion involved. The electroweak symmetry in
an action can be achieved with the following transformation of the electromagnetic
action:

exhaust the four degrees of freedom found in one quaternion potential.
<!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >   The strong force has a Lie algebra <span

a pair of electroweak symmetries. Yet by group theory, multiplying one electroweak

multiplication table, which can be done using a conjugate operator in the following
way:

directed towards finding a group larger than the standard model to include the symmetries

reason why confinement must exist for the strong force, which has hidden from view isolated
quarks. If the only way to have the symmetry of the strong force is to necessarily have two
4-potentials, such a constraint might justify what has been observed. Much more work will need to
be done to see if a smaller model can pass the success already achieved by the standard
model.

hypercomplex field equations. The solutions must be consistent with current tests of gravity,
and different at higher resolution. Covariant derivatives are used throughout, so the
field equations are more complicated than they appear. As is done in general relativity,
work with a metric compatible, torsion-free connection, where a connection is a way to
account for changes in the metric. A covariant derivative contains both the normal
derivative and the connection. Applying two covariant derivatives creates the divergence
of the connection which contains second derivatives of the metric. In principle, the
hypercomplex field equations could provide a second-order differential equation that
must be solved to determine a smoothly changing metric. Assume a static, spherically
symmetric, and electrically neutral gravitational source, as is done for the Schwarzschild
metric.
<!--l. 486--><p class="indent" >   A gauge choice - how one measures things - for the hypercomplex action concerns how to
measure a covariant derivative: how much should be due to the standard derivative versus how
much is due to the connection, the changes in the metric? If one chooses to work with a flat

solution will be the typical charge divided by distance.

will have a striking similarity to the familiar potential solution using charge over distance. Write

<!--l. 657--><p class="indent" >   The deep insight into gravity provided by general relativity is that the geometry of spacetime is
not presumed. In special relativity, the metric must be constant, the same for all inertial observers.
In general relativity, the metric can vary depending on where the observer is in spacetime: being
closer to a mass source will have more spacetime curvature. The Riemann curvature tensor
is a rank 4 tensor that contains second order derivatives of the metric. The Hilbert
action has the Ricci scalar, a contraction of the Ricci tensor which itself is a contraction
of the Riemann curvature tensor. By varying the Hilbert action with respect to the
metric tensor, the geometry of spacetime can change as dictated by the Einstein field
equations.
<!--l. 669--><p class="indent" >   Electromagnetism works no matter what the metric happens to be. The antisymmetric tensor
cannot characterize how the symmetric metric tensor changes, so the possibly dynamic metric
must be supplied as part of the background mathematical structure. By using hypercomplex
multiplication for the GEM action, it becomes possible for the action to account for the changes in
the metric tensor, and thus remove the metric from the background structure. The idea is not to
treat the metric as an active field, but instead to use the diffeomorphism symmetry of the action
to provide a constraint on a metric that varies in spacetime. One can choose how much of a
covariant derivative is due to a dynamic potential or a dynamic metric. Where there is a
symmetry, there is a conserved charge. Since the symmetry involves the metric, the charge

must be mass. Energy and momentum also arise from symmetries in the action, the
ability to vary the action in terms of time and location respectively. Since mass is the
square of the energy minus the square of the momentum, it is logically consistent that
energy, momentum, and mass all can be viewed as different symmetries of the same
action.

General relativity takes a direct approach: start with the Riemann curvature tensor that
characterizes how a metric changes, and put its contraction the Ricci scalar into the action. This
paper uses the symmetry found in the definition of a covariant derivative to allow spacetime
geometry to change based on what mass is in that volume of spacetime. It is the flexibility
of spacetime geometry that indicates the approach can be characterized as a metric
theory.
<!--l. 743--><p class="indent" >   There is a well-known thought experiment imagining a man in a closed box who would be
unable to tell if he was in a smoothly accelerating rocket ship or the box was sitting on the surface
of a planet (ignoring tidal effects). For the box on the planet, general relativity would be
able to generate a metric equation that would, in a limit process, become Newton&#8217;s
potential theory. For the GEM approach, one could choose a dynamic metric which
would be equivalent to first order PPN accuracy to the metric from general relativity, or
with the practical power of diffeomorphisms, choose to work in a flat spacetime and
have a 4-potential completely characterize the gravitational field (see figure 1). A scalar
potential like Newton&#8217;s law of gravity is inadequate because there is only one potential,
so it gets the answer to light bending around the Sun half right. A 4-potential can
describe the way measurements of both time and space are bent by a 4-momentum
density.
<!--l. 758--><p class="indent" >   The unified GEM action may strike some as being too simple to account for all four known
forces. Yet the simplest components in Nature adhere strictly to the rules. Fundamental particles
cannot be programmed to do things. Instead, the rules of accounting dictate what events are
associated with what forces in spacetime. There is only one way to add 4-vectors together so

everything ages in spacetime. With multiplication, there are more choices. Nature keeps multiple
books so gravity, electromagnetism, the weak and strong forces, can all be done by the same
simple particles simultaneously. The field strength density is the product of an operator and a
4-potential. In quantum field theory, an operator is an observable. The operator acting on the
potential may have more freedom that many give it credit. Figuring out how to do
4D math correctly may yield more insights into how physics works at a fundamental

<!--l. 952--><p class="indent" >   The hypercomplex numbers modulo the eigenvalues that equal zero will necessarily have an
inverse. That is a defining property of a division algebra. The real number field mods out these
same sets of numbers because the sum is zero which does not have an inverse. The graph for the
California representation of hypercomplex numbers is a non-directional version of the quaternion
graph as shown in figure 2. Quaternions are accepted as a mathematical field. The change to a
hypercomplex field is that directional edges labeled with imaginary numbers become
non-directional. The self-loops indicate these are not simple graphs. What should be
simple is to establish hypercomplex analysis since the definition of a derivative will be

the same as for real and complex analysis. The self-loops are essential since much of
calculus involves infinitesimal change, or no change at all, which can be achieved with the
self-loops.
<!--l. 967--><p class="indent" >   The hypercomplex numbers modulo eigenvalues equal to zero as a division algebra sidesteps
Frobenius&#8217;s theorem that the only associative, finite dimensional division algebras over the real

Frobenius proof assumes that there are imaginary numbers with <span 
class="cmmi-12">i</span><sup><span

applicable.
<!--l. 975--><p class="indent" >   Here is a big picture view of these two types of products for 4-vectors. Both share exactly the
same identity element. If a force needs a vector product that is antisymmetric as electromagnetism
does, then quaternions may be able to do the job. For a force that is universally attractive such as
gravity, a vector product that is symmetric like that provided by hypercomplex numbers may be
necessary.

<!--l. 1061--><p class="indent" >   One can see the Lie algebra <span 
class="cmmi-12">su</span>(2) as before. The Lie algebra <span 
class="cmmi-12">u</span>(1) only has one degree of
freedom. The three imaginary units are constrained to be those in <span 
class="cmmi-12">su</span>(2), leaving only one degree of
freedom. While quaternions in general do not commute, two quaternions will commute if they
point in exactly the same direction. Writing these two matrices in either order. The result is
equivalent, as required for the Abelian group <span 
class="cmmi-12">U</span>(1). A quaternion with a norm of one that depends
on 3 independent numbers has the symmetry of the weak force, while if it depends on 4 numbers,
has electroweak symmetry.
<!--l. 1071--><p class="indent" >   The final symmetry to include is <span 
class="cmmi-12">SU</span>(3), a group of 8 unitary square matrices with a norm of 1.
There are many ways to represent this group with none using a solitary quaternion since they have
four degrees of freedom. Two quaternions would suffice, yet if two quaternions with a norm of 1
form a product, then they belong in the electroweak group just described. In order to make the
multiplication table different, insist on taking the conjugate of one quaternion and multiplying it
by a second quaternion, which will be called the Euclidean product. Quaternion multiplication
preserves norms, so if both matrices have a norm of 1, the product has a norm of 1. The
Euclidean product is not associative since (<span
