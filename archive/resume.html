<p><b>Summary Statement</b> <br>
Doug is a renaissance nerd, using knowledge from science and mathematics to
direct new projects in the arts and vice-versa. He received two S.B. degrees
from MIT, in biology and chemical engineering, and has a Masters in Software
Engineering at Brandeis. He has extensively exploited art and science educational
opportunities available in Boston to pursue his visions. As a result, Doug
is developing mathematics powerful enough to go head-to-head with Einstein,
backed up by software that can be seen on the web, has a first-rate art collection,
and he cruises through Boston in a bicycle of his own design. <br>

<p><b>Lead Spider, Black Duck Software, Waltham, MA 2004-present</b></p>
 <br>
 The 9th employee of a startup that has grown into an emerging international 
 company.  Have been involved in constructing the knowledgebase of all
 open source projects.  Work involves a mix of adding projects using 
 in-house tools, looking to automate processes, and working on the quality
 of the database.
 
<p><b>Assistant Manager, Customer Accounts, Software Tool &amp; Die, 1998-2002</b></p>
 <br>
The oldest Internet service provider (ISP) on the planet is located in Brookline,
MA.  Doug helped trouble-shoot a range of problems on PCs and Macs.  He wrote
Perl scripts for the billing department, often on his own initiative.

<p><b><a href="quaternions/qindex/qindex.html">Doing Physics with Quaternions</a></b>
 <br>
Constructed all aspects of web site devoted to a new approach to physics.
 Developed mathematics to manipulate 3D space and time consistent with known
laws of physics. Programmed a <a href="java/qcalc/qcalc.html">Java scientific
 calculator</a> that operates on quaternions, real and complex numbers. 
Designed an  <a href="java/animal22/animal22.html">animated 2D world</a>
 as a prototype of a graphic environment that is based on quaternion mathematics.
 Promoted interest in site, with over 3000 visits in a year from every continent.
 <a href="stats/stats.html">Monitored traffic</a>  and updated site as new
math was created.  </p>

<p><b></b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sweetser">YouTube Videos</a>
<br>
Have produced more than 50 videos with over 50,000 views.  Provides the main
channel for the "Stand-Up Physicist" educational project.  These 20+ minute
shows have aired on two local Massachusetts cable channels (Acton and Auburn),
but have reach far more people than the <a href="tsup/tsup.html">page 
devoted to the shows</a>.

<p><b><a href="http://quaternions.sf.net/">Command Line Quaternions</a></b>
<br>
An open source project to that makes animation out of quaternion expressions.
Remember analytic geometry, where writing y = x[sup]2[/sup] generated
a picture? The same expression can now generate a short film.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://drummerfarms.com/">Drummer Farms Condominiums</a></b>
<br>
Designed web site for condominium association using an open source
Content Management System (CMS) called Drupal.  Has slide shows and
video walk throughs of units.  All condominium documents and newsletters
are online.  Owners can see password protected minutes.

<p><b><a href="http://www.dowhile.org">Do While Virtual</a></b> <br>
The Virtual On-Line site of Do While Studio orchestrates events that are
international in scope.  This created a problem in coordinating the times
for events.  Designed digital and analog clocks that give local and Greenwich 
Mean Time which appear at the bottom of each page. </p>

<p><b>Doing physics with quaternions</b> <br>
This research project entails trying to reformulate all the fundamental equations
of physics.&nbsp; The reason for such a large task is to start from one core
hypothesis: events from any object in spacetime are described by the mathematics
of a topological algebraic field, known as the quaternions.&nbsp; This is
an old goal, but Doug has made a number of new insights, including a new
way of expressing the Maxwell equations.  </p>
<p><b>Publication record</b></p>

<p>More than 50 videos on YouTube with over 50,000 views.</p>

<p>Attended the Second Meeting on Quaternionic Structures in Mathematics
 and Physics in Roma, Italy, September 1999.  Presented a paper entitled
 "Maxwell's vision: electromagnetism with Hamilton's quaternions", available 
at http://www.univie.ac.at/EMIS/proceedings/QSMP99/index.html. </p>
  
<p><b>Physics Education</b> <br>
