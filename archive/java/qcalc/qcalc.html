        <p>This is a calculator that can take real, complex numbers or quaternions 
          as input, using the scalar, i, j and k buttons for each part. Results 
          are obtained using the &quot;=&quot; button in the upper corner, and 
          previous result(s) can be seen by pressing the &quot;ans&quot; or &quot;entry&quot; 
          buttons. </p>
        <p>Addition and subtraction remain the same for these fields, but multiplication 
          and division get more complicated.&nbsp; </p>
        <P>Regular multiplication and division becomes what I call the Grassman
product, "x", and Grassman division, "/". Since quaternions do not in general
commute, these get split into the even "&lt;x>" and odd ">x&lt;" parts
which together add up to "x".&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
q1 &lt;x> q2&nbsp; =&nbsp; q2 &lt;x> q1</LI>

<LI>
q1 >x&lt; q2&nbsp; = -q2 >x&lt; q2</LI>

<LI>
q1 &lt;x> q2 + q1 >x&lt; q2&nbsp; =&nbsp; q1 x q2</LI>
</UL>
There are three imaginary vectors, i, j and k.&nbsp; The complement of
a quaternion flips the sign of the these vectors.&nbsp; The Euclidean product
"*" and Euclidean division "\" are formed from taking the complement of
the first quaternion before carrying out the operation.&nbsp; Both of these
can be split into even and odd parts.&nbsp;

<P>Two of these fancy multiplications are actually quite familiar.&nbsp;
The Grassman outer product ">x&lt;" is better known as the cross product.&nbsp;
The even Euclidean product "&lt;*>" is the Euclidean norm.&nbsp; The scalar
part of the Grassman inner product "&lt;x>" looks just like the invariant
interval found in special relativity.&nbsp; The outer Euclidean product
">*&lt;" is still a mystery, but my money says it is related to that mystery
known as spin (since ">x&lt;" deals with angular momentum).&nbsp;

<P>Some patterns to think about...&nbsp;

<P>If only real numbers are used,&nbsp;
<BR>there is no difference between any Grassman and Euclidean products,
and all odd products are zero.&nbsp;

<P>If only complex numbers are used, the odd Grassman product ">x&lt;"
is zero, but not the odd Euclidean product ">*&lt;".&nbsp;

<P>No matter what kind of number is used, the vector part of the even Euclidean
product "&lt;*>" is zero.&nbsp;

<P>No matter what kind of number is used, the vector part of the even Euclidean
product "&lt;*>" is zero.&nbsp;

<P>Identical statements apply to the divisions.&nbsp;

<P>And most important of all, no matter what kind of number is used, the
Grassman product "x" and the Euclidean product "*"&nbsp; are not zero unless
one input is zero.&nbsp;

<P>Of course, you may say, "I don't think this will show up in a supermarket
anytime soon."&nbsp;
<BR>Oh well&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I reserve all rights to this software.&nbsp; Visit and play as you like,
but if you want to use the engine behind this for 3D animations, let's
talk.&nbsp; That's the direction I am headed...&nbsp;
